### Fine-scale diversity due to satellite niches in ecosystems with boom-and-bust cycles

It has long been known that more than one strains with similar functions can coexist in both natural and lab environments, yet the mechanism behind remains as a puzzle. Here, we propose a model to study this coexitence, where strains that obey Monod's growth law undergo boom and bust cycles.
